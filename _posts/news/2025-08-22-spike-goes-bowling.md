On Friday, 22 August, 2025, SPIKE members left behind their laptops, Latex
projects and buggy code, and went on an eventful bowling showdown.

Across two teams and two rounds of games, each player showed their unique skill:

- The ball dropper: let it hit the floor hard and let it roll
- The bicep controller: only forearm swing for maximum(?) accuracy
- Speed speed baby: fast and furious (and somewhat accurate)
- The spins and the curve: intentionally and unintentionally, the ball goes left
  and right
- The comeback king: who cares about missing completely when you can get a
  strike later?
- Get the 14 ball: switch up the weight and somehow it works better
- Ultra competitive: I HAVE TO BEAT YOU

Finally, we congratulate the winner of the bowling showdown: Tom! With a
dominating performance of 277 points, he demolished the competition and claimed
the title of SPIKE Bowling Champion (...for now).

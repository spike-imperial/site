Three of the PhD students from SPIKE had the chance to attend [AAMAS
2025](https://aamas2025.org/) ‚Äì one of the key conferences for autonomous
agents, multiagent systems and reinforcement learning, in Detroit 19th-23rd May.
We were proud to have two papers presented at the conference this year:

* ["Neural DNF-MT: A Neuro-symbolic Approach for Learning Interpretable and
  Editable Policies" by Kexin Gu Baugh, Luke Dickens, and Alessandra
  Russo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03888)

* ["FORM: Learning Expressive and Transferable First-Order Logic Reward
  Machines" by Leo Ardon, Daniel Furelos-Blanco, Roko Paraƒá, and Alessandra
  Russo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00364)

It was exciting to see the engagement and feedback during the poster sessions
and the presentations.

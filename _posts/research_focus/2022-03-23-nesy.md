The SPIKE group has a strong research track record on symbolic knowledge-driven, model-based AI. Although, pure data-driven machine learning have proved to be efective in solving cirucmscrbd tasks, exceeding human performance, it lacks generalisablity, robustness to out of istribution data, and interpretability. In SPIKE we explore and develop novel archtectures for combining advanced symbolic AI solutions with machine learning in order ro overcome their repsecive limitations and leverage upon their renown advantages.

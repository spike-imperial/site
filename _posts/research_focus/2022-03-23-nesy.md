The SPIKE group has a strong research track record on symbolic knowledge-driven, model-based AI. Although, pure data-driven machine learning have proved to be efective in solving cirucmscrbd tasks, exceeding human performance, it lacks generalisablity, robustness to out of istribution data, and interpretability. In SPIKE we explore and develop novel archtectures for combining advanced symbolic AI solutions with machine learning in order to overcome their repsecive limitations and leverage upon their renown advantages.

### **Neuro-Symbolic Reinforcement Learning**

Despite many successes in masteringcomplex tasks, reaching in some cases better performance than humans, pure RL algorithms truggle to discover and exploit teh structure of a task and relevant abstractions. We explore Neuro-Symbolic RL approaches that makes use of state-of-the-art symbolic machine leanring systems to learn state abstractions, abstraction herachcal stricture of tasks and interleave this learning togetther with the RL exploration. This with the objective of improving generalisability and transferbaility of RL policies, whilst facilitating task decomposition and modularity.

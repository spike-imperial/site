Learning interpretable knowledge from data is one of the main challenges of AI. There has been a growing interest in Symbolic Machine Learning, a field of Machine Learning that aims at developing algorithms and systems for learning logic-based programs that explain labelled data within the context of some given background knowledge. 

In SPIKE, our effor in this theme is to develop novel, effective, and scalable symbolic machie learning algorithms and systems that can provide proof guarantees, robustness to noise in the data and customisable through domain-driven optimisation criteria. Our family of symbolic machine leanring systems, including in particular the state-of-the-art systems ILASP and FastLAS, boasts a number of advanced features. They can support the learing of non-monotonic and non-deterministic programs, programs that capture preference reasoning through weak constraints, and programs that include domain-specific hard constraints. All these features make them suitable to tackle real-world problems including learning common-sense interpretable knowledge from unstructured data.

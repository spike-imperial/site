This is a wide area of Artifical Intelligence that builds upon the large body of research and work that fall under what s currently referred to as GOFAI: Good Old Fashion AI. It includes a range of teachiniques for ensuring safety, trustworthiness, robustness and interpretability of AI systems. They range from logic, model-based automated planning, explanation generation, reasoning under uncertanty and incomplete knowledge, diagnosis, and learning. We tackle open research challenges in each of these aspects of symbolic AI with the objective of developing algorithms and systems that are general, scalable and effective in their task, but also based on a rigourous semantics. 

### Abductive inference

### Planning

### Probabilistic Structured Inference



### Symbolic Machine Learning

Learning interpretable knowledge from data is one of the main challenges of AI. There has been a growing interest in Symbolic Machine Learning, a field of Machine Learning that aims at developing algorithms and systems for learning logic-based programs that explain labelled data within the context of some given background knowledge. Our goal to develop novel, effective, and scalable symbolic machine learning algorithms and systems that can provide proof guarantees, robustness to noise in the data and customisable through domain-driven optimisation criteria. Our family of symbolic machine leanring systems, including in particular the state-of-the-art systems ILASP and FastLAS, boasts a number of advanced features. They can support the learing of non-monotonic and non-deterministic programs, programs that capture preference reasoning through weak constraints, and programs that include domain-specific hard constraints. All these features make them suitable to tackle real-world problems including learning common-sense interpretable knowledge from unstructured data.

## Welcome!

<!-- The integration of knowledge into computer systems is becoming increasingly essential in the development of automated solutions to complex problems, which would otherwise require a high-level of human expertise. For example, within the context of pervasive systems, devices have to be able to automatically acquire knowledge about the environment, the context and user’s behaviours, with minimal human intervention, in order to predict and adapt. Knowledge has to be structured, so as to reflect human reasoning and use of logic. At the same time, it may involve probabilistic and/or statistical forms of inference to represent and reason under uncertainty. Modeling has also to be close to how experts solve problems in real life – be amenable to iterative processes of knowledge acquisition, interpretation and elaboration that can be more naturally intertwined with the complex dynamic nature of the environment and the systems that pervasively act within it. -->

The goal of the SPIKE group is to develop data and knowledge-driven solutions for safe, robust and human interpretable AI. We investigate novel frameworks, algorithms, and scalable systems for the automated acquisition and adaptation of structured and probabilistic knowledge from (raw) data. Solutions can be used whether the knowledge is an integrated part of a complex system, or a model of complex dynamic system behaviour. We lead the field of Symbolic Machine Learning and advance the AI landscape in a number of areas groupped under three main themes: Neuro-symbolic AI, Symbolic AI and  practical application to domains such as Healthcare, Decision making, Pervasive and Ubiquitous Systems, Distributed Systems, Security and Privacy.

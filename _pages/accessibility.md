### Accessibility on SPIKE Research Group site
This statement applies to content published on *spike.doc.ic.ac.uk*.

We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:
* Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard.
* Resize to the size of your window, and display a readable text size whichever device you are using.

### How accessible the website is
Parts of this website are not fully accessible. For example:
* Some images do not have good alternative text.
* Some pages have poor colour contrast.
* Linked video content might not not have captions, transcriptions or audio descriptions.

### What we do about known issues
We work to achieve and maintain WCAG 2.1 AA standards, but it is not always possible for all our content to be accessible. Where content is not accessible, we will state a reason, warn users and offer alternatives.

### Technical information about this website's accessibility
The SPIKE Research Group is committed to making its website accessible in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to the known issues listed below.

#### Non accessible content
The content that is not accessible is outlined below with details of where it fails the success criteria, and planned dates for when issues will be fixed.

* Some non-text content that is presented to the user has not a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose.
* Some links have not accessible names.
* Some text elements do not have sufficient contrast against the background.

Some documents and content are [exempt from the regulations](www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made) (such as live video content and PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 if they're not essential to providing our services), so we do not currently have any plans to make them accessible. But if you need to access information in one of these document types, you can contact us and ask for an alternative format.

### Disproportionate burden
Not applicable.

We'll consider your request and get back to you within 7 days.

### Enforcement procedure
